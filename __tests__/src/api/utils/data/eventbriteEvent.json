For example, how to construct state channels that support arbitrary state transitions with minimal on-chain operations? How to route payments to achieve high throughput in an off-chain network that is fundamentally different from data networks? How to help developers to easily build and operate scalable off-chain dApps? How to guarantee that off-chain states are always available for possible disputes?\nIn this meetup, we will describe how Celer Network meets these challenges. Celer embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual component, including generalized state channels that supports fast and generic off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal payment routing algorithm that achieves orders of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development framework and runtime for off-chain dApps; and an incentive-aligned mechanism that provides stable liquidity and high off-chain state availability. We provide our vision for Celer Network 2.0, a grand unification of all off-chain scaling technologies into a single solution. \nWe will also have time to mingle, have some nice beer and fun :D \nThis event is also joined by our friends from Quarkchain and MXC! \n-Celer Network Team","html":"<P>Off-chain scaling techniques such as state channel and side chains are able to support truly scale-out dApps with better privacy and no compromise on the trust-free guarantee.<BR></P>\n<P>Despite its high potentials, off-chain scaling is still in its infancy with challenges remaining unsolved.
